This  toolkit assists in detecting, preventing, and recovering from deadlocks in operating systems. It employs:​
Banker's Algorithm for deadlock prevention
Resource Allocation Graphs (RAGs) for deadlock detection
Process termination or resource preemption strategies for recovery​
A user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter allows for interactive simulations, and visualizations are rendered using NetworkX and Matplotlib.​
